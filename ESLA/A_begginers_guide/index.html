    <p>This website is entitled "Ten Things to Know About Discovering Python: A Beginners Guide".</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-python">What is Python?</h2>
    <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
    <p>It is used for: <br>• web development (server-side), <br>• software development, <br>• mathematics, <br>• system scripting. </p>
    <h2 id="what-can-python-do">What can Python do?</h2>
    <p>• Python can be used on a server to create web applications. <br>• Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. <br>• Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. <br>• Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. <br>• Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. </p>
    <h2 id="why-python">Why Python?</h2>
    <p>• Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). <br>• Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. <br>• Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. <br>• Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. <br>• Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way. </p>
    <h2 id="good-to-know">Good to know</h2>
    <p>• The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this Beginner's Guide. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular. <br>• In this Beginner's Guide, Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse, which are particularly useful for managing larger collections of Python files. </p>
    <h2 id="python-syntax-compared-to-other-programming-languages">Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h2>
    <p>• Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. <br>• Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. <br>• Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. </p>

    <h2 id="execute-python-syntax">Execute Python Syntax</h2>
    <p>As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
    <img src="execute_python_syntax.png" alt="Execute Python Syntax">
    <p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:</p>
    <img src="execute_python_syntax_2.png" alt="Execute Python Syntax 2">
    <h2 id="python-indentation">Python Indentation</h2>
    <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</p>
    <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.</p>
    <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
    <img src="python_indentation.png" alt="Python Indentation">
    <p>Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:</p>
    <img src="python_indentation_2.png" alt="Python Indentation 2">
    <p>The number of spaces is up to the user, the most common use is four, but there must be at least one space.</p>
    <img src="python_indentation_3.png" alt="Python Indentation 3">
    <p>You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:</p>
    <img src="python_indentation_4.png" alt="Python Indentation 4">
    <h2 id="python-variables">Python Variables</h2>
    <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
    <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
    <p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
    <img src="python_variables.png" alt="Python Variables">
    <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular <em>type</em>, and can even change type after they have been set. </p>
    <img src="python_variables_2.png" alt="Python Variables 2">
    <p>If you want to specify the data type of a variable, you can do so with this.</p>
    <img src="python_variables_3.png" alt="Python Variables 3">
    <p>You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.</p>
    <img src="python_variables_4.png" alt="Python Variables 4">
    <p>String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:</p>
    <img src="python_variables_5.png" alt="Python Variables 5">
    <p>Variable names are case-sensitive.</p>
    <img src="python_variables_6.png" alt="Python Variables 6">
    <p>Comment: According to the Oxford Languages dictionary, the adjective "case sensitive" can mean, in the context of a computer program or function, being able to differentiate between upper and lower case.</p>
    <img src="python_variables_7.png" alt="Python Variables 7">
    <h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.</p>
    <p>Comments can be used to make the code more readable.</p>
    <p>Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</p>
    <p>Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:</p>
    <img src="comments.png" alt="Comments">
    <p>Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:</p>
    <img src="comments_2.png" alt="Comments 2">
    <p>A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:</p>
    <img src="comments_3.png" alt="Comments 3">
    <p>Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.</p>
    <p>To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:</p>
    <img src="comments_4.png" alt="Comments 4">
    <p>Or, you can use a multiline string.</p>
    <p>Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:</p>
    <img src="comments_5.png" alt="Comments 5">
    <p>As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.</p>
    <h2 id="python-numbers">Python Numbers</h2>
    <p>There are three numeric types in Python: <br>• int <br>• float <br>• complex </p>
    <p>Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:</p>
    <img src="python_numbers.png" alt="Python Numbers">
    <p>To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:</p>
    <img src="python_numbers_2.png" alt="Python Numbers 2">
    <p>Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.</p>
    <img src="python_numbers_3.png" alt="Python Numbers 3">
    <p>Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.</p>
    <img src="python_numbers_4.png" alt="Python Numbers 4">
    <p>Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.</p>
    <img src="python_numbers_5.png" alt="Python Numbers 5">
    <p>Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:</p>
    <img src="python_numbers_6.png" alt="Python Numbers 6">
    <p>You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:</p>
    <img src="python_numbers_7.png" alt="Python Numbers 7">
    <p>Comment: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.</p>
    <p>Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:</p>
